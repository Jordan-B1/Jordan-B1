### 🖥️ **Developer & Cybersecurity Enthusiast**  
👋 Hi! I'm a developer passionate about **networking, cybersecurity, and embedded systems**. Curious and versatile, I love exploring low-level concepts, optimizing systems, and building robust, high-performance tools.  

🔹 **Techs & stacks**: C, Python, Rust, Node.js, Linux, Docker  
🔹 **Notable projects**:  
   - 🦈 [Cable-Dolphin](https://github.com/Jordan-B1/cable-dolphin) – A packet sniffer inspired by Wireshark  
   - 🔐 [IPsec Tunnel](https://github.com/Jordan-B1/IP-SEC-TUNNEL) – Experimenting with encryption and tunneling  
   - 🌩️ [IoT & Security](https://github.com/soon-coming) – Connected weather stations with Grafana & RFID in C

🚀 I also mentor student projects and organize tech events like [DevMorning]([https://yourlink.com](https://www.meetup.com/paris-devmorning/)).  

📍 Linux-based, always looking for technical challenges and new ideas to explore.  

💡 **Let’s build something cool!**
